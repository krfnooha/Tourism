     * The Temple of the Tooth Sri Lanka popularly known as the “Sri Dalada Maligawa” is one of the most picturesque and iconic Buddhist temples in the country and is a prominent itinerary item in the list of Kandy things to do. Built in the year 1595 during the reign of King Vimaladarmasuriya I, the temple houses the sacred tooth relic of Lord Buddha and therefore is venerated by devotees of the Buddhist faith from all corners of the world.

     Attracting crowds of white-clad pilgrims bearing lotus flowers for means of worship, the Maligawa features a myriad of intricate carvings that speak volumes of the architectural values of Kandy. Named “Mahawahalkada”, the main entrance gates run over the moat and visitors will be awed by the “Sandakada Pahana” or the elaborate moonstone found at the foot of these gates.
     
     However, it is the chamber referred to as “Handun Kunama” that one must venture to for it is where the sacred relic of the Buddha lies. Engraved in gemstones, seven golden caskets protect the relic and one would also find the procession casket in this chamber used for transporting the relic during the colourful Esala Perahera.
     
     The golden canopy constructed over the main shrine of the temple can be viewed from far off while the old royal court of King Vimaladarmasuriya I remains an imposing testament to the imperial rule of the ancient city. The temple is found a mere 3 km from the hotel and allows guests the privilege of setting off on a scenic tour of the premises.<br>

    * The entire temple complex, from peaked tiled roofs to white walls with large airy windows, is built using classical Kandyan architecture. The main shrine has two floors. There are various chambers in the floors including the one where the tooth relic is kept known as ‘handun kunama’.
    
    The door to that chamber is carved in ivory and inside the tooth rests on seven gemstone-studded golden caskets.
    
    The Temple of the Tooth is an art and history lover’s paradise. The first thing a visitor sees as they approach the entrance gates which lie over the moat is the large carved entrance arch with its elephants on either side. The ground before the entrance has a carved ‘welcome mat’, also known as a ‘moon stone’. The moonstone is similar to a full moon cut in half with rows of animals and other carvings depicted in concentric rows inside the sector. The flat area is placed along the edge of the entrance with the curved area facing the visitor.
    
    The insides of the shrine are covered in beautifully detailed and elaborate paintings. With low curved ceilings of corridors and paved floors with their stones polished by a million feet, the shrine transports its visitors to a different age when kings walked the soil of Sri Lanka.
    
    In addition to the main shrine there are other attractions such as the Royal Palace that now spends its days as an archeological museum, the Audience Chamber which now doubles as a chamber for ceremonies, and various other associated structures.
