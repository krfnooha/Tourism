      * Everything there is so peaceful and beautiful, your camera will not have a moment of rest. Walk through mist-covered grasslands, green forests and countless streams. 
        The only sound to be heard is that of the wind or bird’s singing, and the environment will make you feel you never want to go out of this peaceful world.
        The area has amazing bio diversity and you can observe nearly 750 species of plants, 24 species of mammals, 87 species of birds, 09 species of reptiles and 08 species of amphibians.

    * The major attraction at Horton Plains is called “World’s End” – the trail will come to a sudden end at one point, from where one can see the world stretch out to all eternity.
      If you visit the place later than 10 AM all you may see is a white wall. The early morning (between 6am and 10am) is the best time to visit, before the clouds roll in.
      That’s when you’ll see towns as if they are toy towns, tea plantations, villages in the valley below, and a magical view towards the coast.
