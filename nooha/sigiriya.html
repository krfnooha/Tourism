      <h3>City Planning of Sigiriya Rock</h3>
      <center><img src="city.jpg" width="500" height="400">,</center>
      <p>
        *The Lion rock Sigiriya has two fortified precincts where the western precinct encompasses 90 hectares, and the eastern precinct covers 40 hectares. 
         The western area was the royal park area, a symmetrically-designed pleasure garden with elaborate water-retaining structures, as well as surface and subsurface hydraulic systems. It is surrounded by three ramparts and two moats, forming a rectangular area whose inner precincts measure about 700 meters from east to west and 500 meters from north to south.
         On the other side of the Lion rock Sigiriya, the eastern area appears to have been a ceremonial precinct with a large central pavilion as its only permanent structure. Kasyapa and his royal family lived their lives within these walls. 
         Moving inward from the two precincts in an ever-ascending fashion are a series of boulder gardens and then terraced gardens, leading to the entrance to the Sigiriya rock. Access to the rock is gained via a long passageway that begins on the west side of the terrace gardens, and winds northward along the Mirror Wall to the Lion Platform.

      <p>
        *Among the significant features of Sigiriya, the Water Gardens are especially noteworthy.
         Though outwardly the Water gardens appear to be one garden system in Concept, four distinct parts are clearly discernible in its creation, and at present they are called the Water   Garden Nos.
         1, 2 and 3 and the Miniature Water Garden.The Water Garden No. l has symmetrically arranged four larges ’L’- shaped ponds creating an island in the middle. This is considered a special feature found in ancient garden designs and is termed “Char-Bagh’ and this specimen in Water Garden No. 1 seems to be the most ancient one extent in the world today. The Water Garden No. 2 has fountains, and hence is also called the Fountain Garden. Two summer palaces flank either side of this Fountain Garden. Visitors will wonder how the fountains were fed with water. The answer lies in the moats built round the summer palaces, connected tó concealed subterranean channels, which feed . the. fountains ingeniously arid unobtrusively. 
         Water Garden No.  3 is located  at  a  higher elevation  and has and asymmetrical lay-out,  the  balance and symmetry of the other sections of the garden system being absent here. . The Miniature Water Garden is a ‘miniaturized’ refinement of the other three garden systems, a kind of   micro scale-model   of   die total concept. The inter-connection between the different parts of the Water Gardens and the Overall balance,' symmetry and integration. Thereby achieved is indeed a triumph.
